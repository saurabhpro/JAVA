 * better solution is possible in O(n) time.
 * <p>
 * Below is the Algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Create a map to store frequency of each number in the array. (Single traversal is required)
 * In the next traversal, for every element check if it can be combined with any other element (other than itself!) to give the desired sum. Increment the counter accordingly.
 * After completion of second traversal, weâ€™d have twice the required value stored in counter because every pair is counted two times. Hence divide count by 2 and return.
