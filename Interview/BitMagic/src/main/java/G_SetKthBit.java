/**
 * To set any bit we use bitwise OR | operator. As we already know bitwise OR | operator evaluates each bit
 * of the result to 1 if any of the operandâ€™s corresponding bit is set (1). In-order to set kth bit of a number
 * we need to shift 1 k times to its left and then perform bitwise OR operation with the number and result
 * of left shift performed just before.
 * <p>
 * In general, (1 << k) | n.
