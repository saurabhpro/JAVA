We can summarize Polymorphism principle with the following two rules:
1. The type of the **object** determines which properties exist within the object in memory.
2. The type of the **reference** to the object determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program.

One of the advantages of **object composition** over inheritance is that it tends to promote greater code reuse. By using object composition, you gain access to other classes and methods that would be dif cult to obtain via Java’s single‐inheritance model.
