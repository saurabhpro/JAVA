	 * In Java, all classes inherit from the Object class directly or indirectly.

	 * and Object class is root of the tree.
	 *
	 * In Java, if we create a class that doesnâ€™t inherit from any class then it automatically inherits from Object class .

	 * You would think this class extends two classes Object + TheObjectInheritanceConundrum

	 * As written above this is an example of classic INDIRECT inheritance to Object inheritance
	 *
	 * So for MyLifeMyChoice its only extending TheObjectInheritanceConundrum which does the Object thingy
