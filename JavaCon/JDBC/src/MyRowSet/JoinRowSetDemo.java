/**
 * Created by Saurabh on 11/28/2015. Is used to hold data coming from two or more tables. It can be achieved by using
 * the join in SQL. that JoinRowSet has equivalent of SQL JOIN without having to connect to a data source. In order to
 * get the joined data one column in both tables should be common. This common column is known as the Match column.
 * <p>
 * The match column is set by calling addRowSet() method for each RowSet object with the column index and the RowSet
 * objects witch you want to join.
