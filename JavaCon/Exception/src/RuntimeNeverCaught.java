/**
 * RuntimeException (or anything inherited from it) is a special case,
 * since the compiler doesnï¿½t require an exception specification for these types.
 * The output is reported to System.err:
 * <p>
 * You never need to write an exception specification saying that a method might
 * throw a RuntimeException (or any type inherited from RuntimeException),
 * because they are unchecked exceptions. [you cant do anything about it]
 * <p>
 * If a RuntimeException gets all the way out to main( ) without being caught,
 * printStackTrace( ) is called for that exception as the program exits.
