 * A Study of how highly composite number (Anti-Prime) numbers are found (Ramanujan)
 * num = p1^a1 x p2^a2 x ... pk^ak<br/>
 * Total Number of factors of a number = (a1 + 1) x (a2 + 1) + .... + (ak + 1) <br/>
 * It should have three properties <br>
 * 1. the prime factors (p1, p2,...) has to be consecutive
 * 2. the powers (a1, a2,...) has to be weekly decreasing, so a1 >> a2 >> a3 >> ...
 * 3.
