* Greedy Algo

Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?


```
If V == 0, then 0 coins required.
If V > 0
   minCoin(coins[0..m-1], V) = min {1 + minCoins(V-coin[i])} 
                               where i varies from 0 to m-1 
                               and coin[i] <= V 
```
